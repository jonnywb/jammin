# Jammin'

This application was built using Create React App, and was something that I worked on in preperation for my October 2023 Bootcamp with Northcoders. Using Codecademy, I learned some basic tools before the course even began. My plan was to learn as much as possible before the course, so that I could make the most of all information that was given. It would also enable me to create more advanced work when arriving at project phase. This does not mean that I didn't learn much throughout the course however, as many new skills including testing, paired programming, and also helped me to gain a better understanding and foundation of the skills I was learning.

I've included this project in my portfolio as I think it can show my ability to quickly pick up new skills in a short amount of time. It has many inaccuracies, because my foundation and understanding was not as good at this point, but I believe that if you look at the difference between this project and my later projects, you'll be able to see a good difference in the quality of code and understanding of things - expecially promises, when fetching from the Spotify API is concerned.


## More Info from Create React App:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
